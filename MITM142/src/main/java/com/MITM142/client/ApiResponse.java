 * S³ Platform API
 * This demo provides access to a limited set of features.   For more advanced capabilities, please contact us at our contact page - https://www.s-3.team/#contact-index  __Overview__  S³ Platform is a cloud-native cluster-based data storage solution. It implements number of sharding algorithms and strategies to achieve good performance and robustness. Before we begin with the user part, familiarize yourself with the following helpful terminology:  * <b>Key/Value Store</b> - Key/Value Store is a type of database system where data is stored and retrieved using unique keys associated with corresponding values. It provides a simple and efficient method for storing and accessing data, often used in applications requiring fast and flexible data storage solutions. * <b>Hash Map</b> - Hash Map is a data structure that stores key-value pairs and provides efficient retrieval of values based on their associated keys or object keys. It uses a hashing function to map keys to indexes, allowing for fast access to stored values. * <b>Sorted Set</b> - Sorted Set is a data structure similar to a set, but with the additional feature of maintaining the elements in sorted order based on a defined criterion, typically their scores or values. This structure enables efficient retrieval of elements in a specific order, making it useful for tasks like ranking or priority queues. * <b>Clustered Hash Map</b> - Clustered Hash Map is a distributed data structure that combines the features of a hash map with clustering capabilities, allowing it to span across multiple nodes in a cluster. This enables efficient storage and retrieval of key-value pairs while distributing the data load across the cluster for improved scalability and fault tolerance. * <b>Clustered Sorted Set</b> -  Clustered Sorted Set is a distributed data structure that combines the features of a sorted set with clustering capabilities, enabling it to span across multiple nodes in a cluster. This allows for efficient storage and retrieval of elements in sorted order while distributing the workload across the cluster for scalability and fault tolerance. * <b>Multi Index</b> - Multi Index is a data structure that allows for indexing of items based on multiple criteria simultaneously. It enables efficient querying and retrieval of items using various combinations of criteria, offering flexibility and optimization in data access for diverse applications. * <b>TimeSeries</b> - TimeSeries is a data structure optimized for storing and querying time-stamped data points or events in chronological order. It enables efficient retrieval, aggregation, and analysis of temporal data, making it ideal for applications such as monitoring, analytics, and trend analysis. * <b>BM25 Search</b> - BM25 (Best Matching 25) is a ranking function used in information retrieval to estimate the relevance of documents to a given search query. It's based on the probabilistic model of information retrieval, considering factors like term frequency and document length normalization. * <b>Regex Search</b> - Regex (Regular Expression) search involves using patterns to match text based on specific rules or sequences of characters. It allows for complex and flexible text searching and manipulation, enabling users to find and extract information efficiently based on customizable patterns. * <b>Auto Completion Search</b> - Auto Completion Search is a feature that predicts and suggests possible completions for a search query as the user types, based on existing data or patterns in the database. It enhances user experience by speeding up the search process and reducing typing effort, leading to more accurate and efficient results. * <b>Vector Search Storage</b> - Vector Search Storage organizes data as multi-dimensional vectors, enabling similarity-based searches that retrieve contextually relevant results. This technology enhances user experience by delivering more accurate, context-aware information, ideal for applications like recommendations and image searches. * <b>Vector Search Storage Worker</b> - Vector Search Workers are websocket-based processes designed to manage distributed vector search by processing queries across assigned data shards. Each worker receives and answers queries in real time, supporting various indexing methods: in-memory flat index for quick, direct access, HNSW for scalable approximate nearest neighbor search, SQLite-Vec for lightweight embedded database needs, and PG-Vector for relational data integration within Postgres. * <b>Distributed File Storage</b> - Distributed File Storage refers to a system architecture where files are stored across multiple storage nodes, rather than a single centralized server. This approach enhances scalability, fault tolerance, and performance by distributing the storage load across a network of interconnected nodes. * <b>Distributed Atomic Counters</b> - Distributed Atomic Counters are data structures used in distributed computing environments to maintain a shared counter value across multiple nodes while ensuring atomicity of operations. They enable concurrent increment and decrement operations across the distributed system without risking inconsistencies or race conditions. * <b>Distributed Locks</b> - Distributed locks are synchronization mechanisms used in distributed systems to coordinate access to shared resources among multiple nodes. They ensure mutual exclusion, allowing only one node at a time to access or modify a critical section of code or data, even in a distributed environment. * <b>Distributed Message Queue</b> - Distributed Message Queue (MQ) is a communication mechanism used in distributed systems to facilitate asynchronous messaging between different components or services. It enables decoupling of sender and receiver, allowing for scalable and fault-tolerant communication by storing messages temporarily until they are processed by the intended recipient. * <b>JWT (JSON Web Token)</b> - JSON Web Token (JWT) is a compact and self-contained mechanism for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. It is commonly used for authentication and authorization in web applications, providing a digitally signed token that can be verified and trusted. * <b>RSA Public Private Key Pair</b> - RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) is a widely used asymmetric encryption algorithm that utilizes a pair of keys: a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption. Information encrypted with the public key can only be decrypted using the corresponding private key, ensuring secure communication and data integrity. * <b>User API Secret</b> - A User API Secret is a confidential authentication credential used to verify the identity of a user or application interacting with an API. It serves as a secure token, typically shared only between the user/application and the API provider, ensuring secure access to protected resources. * <b>Regex Based Permission Control</b> - Regex-based permission control is a method of managing access rights using regular expressions to define patterns for resource names or actions. It allows for flexible and granular permission assignment by matching user roles or permissions against predefined patterns, enabling precise control over access to specific resources or functionalities. * <b>Auto-Resharding</b> - Auto-resharding is an automated process used in distributed databases to dynamically adjust the partitioning of data across nodes in response to changes in the system's configuration or workload. It helps maintain balanced data distribution, optimize performance, and accommodate fluctuations in resource demand without manual intervention. * <b>Cursor Count Iteration</b> - Cursor count iteration method involves using a cursor to navigate through a dataset while also counting the number of items returned. It allows for efficient pagination and processing of large datasets by providing both the data and the total count of items, enabling streamlined navigation and analysis. * <b>Offset Limit Iteration</b> - Offset limit iteration method involves fetching a specific subset of data from a dataset by specifying an offset (starting point) and a limit (number of items to retrieve). It's commonly used for pagination in database queries, enabling efficient retrieval of data in chunks while controlling the amount of data returned in each query.  Synonyms:  * Entry and record are interchangeable. * Clustered datastructure and c-structure are interchangeable.
